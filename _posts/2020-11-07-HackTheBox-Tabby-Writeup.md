# []()Methodology

* nmap scan
* LFI Lead to read tomcat user credentials
* exploitation by Metasploit
* crack zip file fcrackzip 
* own user
* Privilege Escalation

# []()Nmap Scan

> as always, iâ€™ll do nmap scan to find out which services running in this machine.

* 8080 for apache tomcat

* 22 for ssh

* from nmap scan i know that there is a apache tomcat server.

```ruby

> after looking at the source code i found the way to exploit LFI, let's see how.

# []() LFI Part

* from the source code i've found the url: http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=

> the file parameter was vulnerable to LFI, let's check it.

* now we have lfi, let's check the port 8080 now.

> from this page we know that the users data we will find it at **tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml**, let's use lfi now.

* from Apache tomcat [Docs](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/manager-howto.html) i know that the file will be in **/usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml**

* if you are a linux user you will know that without any blogs because any program data will be found at **/usr/share**

> here is the credentials for apache tomcat server.

> now we have the credentials, let's use metasploit now to exploit this service.
